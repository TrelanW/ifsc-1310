  <h2>Mars Rover Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
  <p> I asked for my brother's feedback. The first thing he said looking at the page is that didn't like how small the 
    the log was in the top left corner. Which I kind of saw what he was talking about so I went ahead and increase the size of the logo. Next thing was that he didn't like how the boxes with the images of the rovers weren't the same size. Which I defenitily could see where he was coming from I was just too lazy to fix it. However, with him saying that I dedcided to just boss up and fix it. He also thought it would be a good idea to have a timeline where on mission page when bringing up all the dates. Which I'm actually kind of mad I didn't think of first. So, it was added. As for the reflection of the project itself. I was honestly amazed about how much code I actually reused which made the project not that difficult at all. </p>
    <p> Semester wise I really enjoyed the class. The way it was taught and progressed was made to set us up for sucess on the final project. I felt as though the final project was just applying everthing we learned into one big assignment which I loved since I actually learned it. Being able to go to class just code along with the teach was really helpful especially when running into any errors in my code.</p>

    <h2>Progressive Enhancement Writing Assignment</h2>
    <p>Progressive enhancement is a web design method which emphasizes crafting websites starting from a solid foundation. It begins with basic functionality and content using bare HTML, then augments styles with CSS and adds interactive features with JavaScript. The core objective behind this approach is that the most critical components of a website, which includes its content as well as structure, must be accessible to every user, regardless of their devices and browsers.</p>
    <p>Progressive enhancement is worth it when it comes to modern web development because it improves accessibility, supports a wider range of users, and makes the site more reliable. It also helps with search engine optimization since the content itself is available right away in the HTML. If something fails the rest of the site can still work. Here is a good article about it -
