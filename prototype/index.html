            <p>The student life at UA Little Rock is typical of public universities in the United States. It is characterized by student-run organizations and affiliation groups that support social, academic, athletic, and religious activities and interests. Some of the services offered by the UA Little Rock Office of Campus Life are intramural sports and fitness programs, diversity programs, leadership development, peer tutoring, student government association, student support programs including groups for non-traditional and first-generation students, a student-run newspaper, and fraternity and sorority life. The proximity of the UA Little Rock campus to downtown Little Rock enables students to take advantage of a wide array of recreational, entertainment, educational, internship, and employment opportunities that are not available anywhere else in Arkansas.[20]</p>

            <h3>Campus living</h3>
            <p> UA Little Rock provides a variety of on-campus living options for students ranging from traditional resident rooms to multiple-bedroom apartments. The university has four residence halls on the eastern side of the campus and the University Village Apartment Complex[21] on the southern side of campus. Six learning communities focusing on criminal justice, arts and culture, majors and careers, future business innovators, nursing careers, and STEM are available to students.</p>

            <h3>Athletics</h3>
            <p> UA Little Rock's <em>14 athletic teams</em> are known as the <q>Little Rock Trojans</q>, with almost all teams participating in the Sun Belt Conference. Little Rock is one of two Sun Belt members that do not sponsor football (UT Arlington being the other); UA Little Rock last fielded a football team in 1955 when it was known as Little Rock Junior College. Little Rock's main athletic offices are located in the Jack Stephens Center. UA Little Rock offers the following sports: </p>

            <h4>The Two Little Rock teams that don't compete in the Sun Belt:</h4>
            <p> Are the <strong>women's swimming and diving team</strong> (Missouri Valley Conference) and <strong>wrestling</strong> (Pac-12 Conference), neither of which the Sun Belt sponsors. Wrestling is the school's newest sport, starting in 2019, and is the first Division I program in Arkansas.</p>

            <h3>Collections and archives</h3>
            <p>On July 1, 2014, the UA Little Rock Collections and Archives division was created. The division encompasses:</p>
            <ul>

                <li>Center for Arkansas History and Culture</li>
                <li>Sequoyah National Research Center</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Apex Legends™: Takeover Patch Notes</h3>
            <h4>LEGEND BUFFS</h4>
            <p>Leading the charge this season are two Assault Legends who've been flying under the radar and are ready to explode: Ash and Ballistic.</p>

            <h5>ASH</h5>
            <p>Ash sees a number of improvements this season to her Arc Snare and Phase Breach to make them more effective and reliable. Her snare change lets her snag targets against the strong edge of the tether more often. Her Ult goes farther, travels faster, and endpoint detection has improved to make the targeting stickier and less prone to accidental bad snapping.</p>
            <p>The big change for Ash is her new passive: Predator's Pursuit. This grants her an omnidirectional short-range dash—enabling her to close the gap on a tethered target or evade swiftly in a close-quarters skirmish. With these changes, Ash is set to become the Apex Predator she was always meant to be.</p>

            <h5>Ballistic</h5>
            <p>Ballistic sees some of his favorite upgrades, the extra charge and sling levelling, integrated into his base kit, giving him more utility and versatility in the early game. A new Level 3 upgrade allows him to double his Whistler charges, opening up his utility and crowd control potential immensely.</p>
            <p>Tempest, his Ult, now also grants a speed bonus—making him a frightening force when he and his team bare down on you. But the big guns? Ballistic's sling can now carry crate weapons, which can spool with infinite ammo when Tempest is active. In Takeover, Ballistic may very well relive his glory days.</p>
