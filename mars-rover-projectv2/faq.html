      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <h3>What is the purpose of NASA's Mars Rovers?</h3>
      <p>NASA's rovers are built to explore the surface of Mars, gather data on the planet's geology and atmosphere, search for signs of past life, and test technology for future human missions.</p>

      <h3>How do the rovers get to Mars?</h3>
      <p>Rovers are launched on rockets from Earth and travel millions of miles through space. They enter Mars' atmosphere and land using advanced systems like parachutes and sky cranes.</p>

      <h3>Why were Gale Crater and Jezero Crater chosen as landing sites?</h3>
      <p>Both locations show strong evidence of having once held water. Gale Crater has sedimentary layers, while Jezero Crater contains a preserved river deltaâ€”both ideal for studying the possibility of ancient life.</p>

      <h3>How do rovers send information back to Earth?</h3>
      <p>Data is transmitted from the rover to satellites orbiting Mars, which then relay the information back to Earth via NASA's Deep Space Network.</p>

      <h3>How are Curiosity and Perseverance powered?</h3>
      <p>They use nuclear batteries called Multi-Mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators (MMRTGs), which provide long-lasting power and allow them to operate through dust storms and cold Martian nights.</p>

      <h3>What is the Ingenuity helicopter?</h3>
      <p>Ingenuity is a small drone launched with the Perseverance rover. It became the first aircraft to make powered, controlled flights on another planet.</p>
